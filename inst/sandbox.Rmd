This is an example of running your code within a sandbox. write your code as normal, but wrap it within a "sandbox" function. Your code will now be evaluated within its own R session, and outputs will be returned to your console.

```{r sandbox}

library(sandbox)

sandbox({
  suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(tidyverse)
  })
  
  attach(diamonds)
  
  ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price)) + geom_point()
  
})

```

This may seem pointless, but now the output and dirtyness that results from loading large/competing libraries into your environment are contained into small sections of your code, and cannot interfere with other chunks. 

```{r}

ls()
"tidyverse"%in%loadedNamespaces()

```

This is just the beginning, with future work to allow the export of specific objects from the environments, logging, etc
